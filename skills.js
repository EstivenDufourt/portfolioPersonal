        description: "During my experience as a Data Analyst at GoldenHass, I had the privilege of working on the pest analysis project in the avocado crop. The first task I had was to collect and analyze data from pest situations from field reports and historical data. I used statistical analysis tools to identify patterns of pest presence in the avocado crop over time. Once the data collection and analysis was completed, I faced the task of creating a graphical interface for data visualization. I used visualization tools such as Tableau and R to create dynamic graphics that showed the evolution of pest presence in the avocado crop.",

The map will show the different levels of severity of pests in specific regions. The user can interact with the map to view data for a specific region or to view aggregated data for the entire region. The data can be filtered by type of pest, amount of pests, and other parameters. The data will be gathered from local farmers and will be updated weekly to show an accurate picture of the severity of pests in the fields. The goal of this project is to provide farmers with accurate information about the level of threat of pests in their fields so that they can make informed decisions about pest control.",
